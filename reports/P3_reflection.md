# P3 Reflection

This sprint focused on adding testing tools. The addition of two static analysis tools, two regression testing tools, and two automatic test generation tools will aid in testing our implementation of the semester project. The main takeaways our team had from this sprint were how to add tools to our maven project, and how to extract useful information from them. In addition, we familiarized ourselves with the concepts of static analysis, regression testing, and automatic test generation and what the tools are capable of doing.

While adding the Spotbugs plugin was a simple task it was somewhat of an ordeal for use to get Spotbugs to display the bugs it found in a comprehensible format. After solving this problem we were able to use Spotbugs to identify several bugs within our code. However, most of the bugs that were found were either not fixable or deemed too pedantic and we would therefore gain effectively nothing from fixing them. PMD is a more usable plugin, but does not duplicate functionality of Spotbugs. PMD bugs were mostly poor programming style (such as too many parantheses) and Spotbugs found bugs such as exposing references to objects that the programmer may not want. As static analysis tools, best practice would likely be to use both.

The implementation of Clover went pretty well. We experienced the error message that the P3 documentation warned we may run into, but the provided solution allowed us to get it up and running without a hitch. The issues found by the static analysis tools and addressed by the team did not trigger any of the tests generated by Clover on its second run.

Implementing Evosuite was a relatively simple process. Ran into some issues that were due to not having the cs415 module loaded. After loading the cs415 module, Evosuite was able to generate tests and the rest of the instructions for Evosuite were extremely easy to follow. All of the tests generated by Evosuite passed.
