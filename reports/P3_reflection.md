- Short paragraph here about experience we had with the static analysis tools.

The implementation of Clover went pretty well.

The issues found by the static analysis tools and addressed by the team did not trigger any of the tests generated by Clover on its second run.
- Short paragraph here about experience we had with automatic test generation tools.
