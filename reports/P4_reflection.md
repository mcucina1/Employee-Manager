# P4 Reflection
This sprint was heavily focused on the implementation and testing of the various RestController endpoints that will be utilized by the client and server during our next sprint. Our team learned quite about about the design and implementation of these types of endpoints, and also was able to gain experience working with Mockito to mock a DBConnector. We encountered many new concepts, puzzles, and breakthroughs throughout the course of this sprint.
