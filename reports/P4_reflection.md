# P4 Reflection
This sprint was heavily focused on the implementation and testing of the various RestController endpoints that will be utilized by the client and server during our next sprint. Our team learned quite about about the design and implementation of these types of endpoints, and also was able to gain experience working with Mockito to mock a DBConnector. We encountered many new concepts, puzzles, and breakthroughs throughout the course of this sprint. 

While using mockito and http fluent libraries for testing our API endpoints, we learned how to mock a database with "canned" data and how to use said data to check if our endpoints were behaving properly. GET, POST, and PUT requests required slightly different testing. For the most part it was just testing that the requests were actually receiving the correct data or creating or changing objects on the server. Requests with varaibles in the URL and JSON bodies were used.
