# P2 Reflection

P2 was a successful group effort that led to us producing what we believe to be a well tested application. During
P1, everyone contributed at a steady and continuous rate and this is how we hoped P2 would go as well. However, due
mostly to midterms we got a later start on the project than hoped. Luckily good communication and contributions
being made when possible led to the results we were hoping for. During P1 we met outside of class more often than
during P2. Our team was able to navigate this change by having good communication over Teams.

The Company class was more difficult to implement than the Qualification, Worker, and Project classes and as a
result we hit more roadblocks than expected. Because Company is responsible for coordinating Qualifications, 
Worker, and Project classes more tests were required than expected. The ISP tables for some of the methods got
quite large as certain methods such as assign interact with 8 variables. With the added complication of considering 
how to incorporate base choice testing, we ended up with some large pull requests. In the end we were able to kill 
greater than 95% of mutants that showed up in mutation testing, and check our implementation through a combination
of ISP tables, base choice testing, and test driven development.

In future sprints we will start earlier and meet in person more frequently. It is good to know that we were able to
work effectively asynchronously, but better planning from the beginning will likely lead to less stress later in
the sprint. We look forward to learning about static analysis tools and automatic generation of tests during P3, to
see how our implementation holds up.
